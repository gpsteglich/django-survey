About
=====

Dynamic Forms is a framework developed on Python-Django made for the creation 
of surveys supporting multipaging and multipath. This means it supports the 
creation of pages and the definition of a question path logic that determines 
if a question has to be shown or hidden. The aforementioned surveys are created 
on a user-friendly webpage tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet 
Explorer.
The development of this application focused on being extensible so that the creation 
and/or modification of new types of questions (fields) could be done easily.
